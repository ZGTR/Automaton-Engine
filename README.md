# Automaton + Regular Expression Engine

<strong>Breif</strong>
<br/>This solution serves as an implementation of different Automaton. DFA, NFA, eNFA, Regular Expression, Minimised DFA, etc. You can find the heirarchy here:

<strong>Code + Timestamp</strong>
<br/>This is the Visual Basic version of the code + WPF for the UI. There's a C# version for those who want. I coded this back in early 2011.

<strong>UI</strong>
<br/>The system has a simple UI to convert from one Automaton type to another. It also has the ability to draw the Regular Expression graph and also animate and highlight user-defined test cases.
